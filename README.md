ðŸ”§ Full Adder â€“ Structural Modeling in Verilog
This project demonstrates the structural modeling approach to implement a 1-bit full adder using Verilog HDL. The design mimics the gate-level architecture by interconnecting basic logic modules such as AND, OR, and XOR gates.

ðŸ“˜ Overview
A full adder is a fundamental building block in digital electronics, used to add three 1-bit binary numbers: A, B, and Cin (carry-in). The outputs are:

Sum: Result of the addition

Cout: Carry-out to the next stage

This implementation uses structural modeling, where the full adder is built by instantiating and wiring together gate-level modules.

ðŸ§  Logic Diagram
The full adder logic is based on:

Sum  = A âŠ• B âŠ• Cin
Cout = (A & B) | (B & Cin) | (Cin & A)


ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/PRADEEP-lab-tasks/Full_Adder_Sturctural_modelling.git
cd Full_Adder_Sturctural_modelling
Open the files in your preferred Verilog simulator (ModelSim, Vivado, etc.)

Compile and run testbench.v to verify all input combinations.

Expected Output
The testbench covers all 8 combinations of inputs (A, B, Cin) and prints the corresponding Sum and Cout. You should see correct results matching the truth table of a full adder.

Learning Outcomes
Understand structural modeling in Verilog
Practice modular design and gate-level abstraction
Simulate and verify combinational logic circuits

ðŸ§  Author Notes
This project is ideal for beginners in digital design and HDL. Feel free to fork, modify, or extend it into multi-bit adders or integrate it into ALU designs.
