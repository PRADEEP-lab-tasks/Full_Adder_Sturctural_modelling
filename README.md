# Full_Adder_Sturctural_modelling
Full Adder â€“ Structural Modeling in Verilog This repository demonstrates the structural modeling approach to implement a 1-bit full adder using Verilog HDL. The design is composed by interconnecting basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) to reflect the gate-level architecture of a full adder circuit.
